In PA I spent a few years working in a casino as a poker dealer before deciding that wasn't for me and enrolling in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.",

By focusing on Web Development, I could learn the required technologies and techniques for making websites. Not only that, but learning the programming is a never-ending (and sometimes frustrating) learning experience.",
